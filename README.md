python-cookbook
==============

I suddenly remembered last year around this time I was in love with this python thing. So, I took drastic measures. I started reading [Python Cookbook, 3rd edition](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920027072.do).

Install
----
`git clone https://github.com/stefanilie/python-cookbook.git`


Usage
---

After cloning, simply `cd python-cookbook` and run `python menu.py`. Follow the steps for executing several sections in the book.

If you want to see the code, open the file needed based on the chapter. This will be replaced in the following versions.
